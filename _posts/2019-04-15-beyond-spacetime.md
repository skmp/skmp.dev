title: Modeling reality as a multi-dimentional mathematical space
img: head-blown.jpg
---

Basis
---
- Treat x, y, z, time as dimentions
- Treat energy as dimentions
- Treat mass, capacitance, etc as dimentions

Proposal
---
Apply an N-dimentional laplace transform to the exising physics laws to make them time invariant.
Apply a fourier transform in the data before and after
See how the maths looks

Reasoning / general idea
---
- Observer-based general relativity -- objective reality cannot be measured
- "The cosmos" can be modeled as a multi dimentional space, where every possible arrangement of particles, energies and forces exists. (loosely derived from infinitive muliverses)
- Observer-transforms project this multi dimentional space into measurements
- This model is time-invariant - time is just another dimention

Benefits
---
- If the maths checks out, it could provide a time-invariant equation set to make predictions
- Much less computationally expensive - you can use fft to get in/out and then do "frequency domain" linear solving instead of exponential "time domain" one
-- Similar to how convolution simplifies to an addition on 1d/2d fourier/laplace
- Much more convinient form of storage, compressible representation (in the spirit of DCT)
