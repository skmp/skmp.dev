title: Another Code Cache approach for hex-emu (fex-emu derivative/fork)
img: fex-aotir-clang.png
---

As part of the work for fex/hex I implemeneted a [multi-threaded, multi-process, just-in-time object code cache](https://gitlab.com/hex-emu/hex-emu/-/merge_requests/1842).

There were several challenges involved
- Unlike aotir, the index cannot be sorted, so it got stored as a BST
- Similarly, the format had to be crash / atomic safe
- AOTOBJ was the goal, so relocations were needed. This was done seperatelly iirc.

Key features include
- Reading from the caches requires a shared lock.
- Writing to the caches necessitates a unique lock and an advisory lock when resizing the index or data files.
- Index files are re-mapped as they grow in 64kb chunks.
- Data files are mapped in chunks of 16 Megabytes.
- Settings have been refined, merging AOT[IR/OBJ]Load and AOT[IR/OBJ]Capture to [IR/OBJ]Cache. The AOTIRGenerate has been removed, and a separate executable, FEXAOTGen, is now used.

How does it perform?

Some performance numbers from Orion

No Cache

Best OBJCache result so far
